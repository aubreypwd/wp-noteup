== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =

* The metabox now says "Notes" instead of "WP NoteUp"
* Allow Notes on other Post Types, just visit Settings > General
* Added many new filters that make this more customizable

= 1.1.4 =

* Major fixes to work with WordPress 4.7.2!
* Notes were lost when the postbox was moved around from the side to the "normal" area and back in the Post edit screen.
* So, for now, we've disabled the NoteUp metabox from being in side, and do not allow it to be dragged around to different areas. Don't worry, we don't break any of your other post-boxes!

= 1.1.3 =

* Yet another small change in hopes that activation through WordPress.org is again possible.

= 1.1.2 =

* Another small tweak fixing the issue people are having activating the plugin.

= 1.1.1 =

* Small tweak that keeps other Add Media buttons from showing up in the NoteUp box.

= 1.1 =

* This major update, dubbed Cube, was entirely focused on updating the experience of note taking to include formatting and media. Special thanks to the [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) crew [@webdevstudios](http://webdevstudios.com).

= 1.0 =

* Initial release that allows simple text notes on Posts and Pages.
